<!-- This document is notes from javascript course at General Assembly-->

<p>Data types = strings, numbers, booleans, NAN
  Variables(store data temporarily)
  conditional statements
  logical and comparison operators
  reusable code (methods, functions) </p>

  DRY programming - do not repeat yourself
  brittle code, breaks easily if you have lots of stuff repeated everywhere.
  not as efficient

  Data types - strings

  string in single quotes
  array is in brackets

  var dogs =['corgi', 'golden retriever', 'labrador;

  start with letters not numbers, use camel case

  var corgi = function () {
    return 'dog';
  }

numbers:
var numberOne = 1;
var negativeOne = -1;
javascript supports four different types of numbers. (floats, integers)

boolean:
var dog = true;
var cat = false;

used more in object oriented programming
use when you want the situation/condition to be one or the other

Conditional statement:
if (corgi==='dog'){
  return true;
}else if (corgi==='cat'){
  return false;
}
triple = signs is absolutely looking for equal to, == double is relative comparison, = single equal sign is assignment.
FUNCTIONS
words in parentheses are either parameter or arguments.
this function will print to the console

function corgisRule () {
  console.log('Corgi's like totally rock');

}
corgisRule();

Event Listeners - listen for behaviors (on click, mouse up/down, page scroll, right click, etc.)
so we bind our functionality to an event listeners
to listen for behavior

Corgi\'s  ( backslash is the escape character)

happy path - when we write code and code works
QA will try to break your code.
throw different conditions at it
